The housing shortage in the Netherlands in the last few years has led to a serious housing crisis experienced today. Especially young people are encountering major difficulties in finding the right place for an affordable price. Also during the last political party elections, the housing crisis was a very much debated topic. For this reason, Team 2 realized the significance of creating a dataset that can give both house seekers and house sellers more insights into the housing market in the Netherlands. Mainly, the aim of creating this dataset is to make a houseâ€™s selling duration more predictable. For both parties this can lead to a more efficient housing market: house sellers can better predict for what period their house will be on sale, whilst house seekers get insights into the selling rate in a particular city.
