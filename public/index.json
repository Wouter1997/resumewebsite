Especially young people are encountering major difficulties in finding the right place for an affordable price. Also during the last political party elections, the housing crisis was a very much debated topic. For this reason, Team 2 realized the significance of creating a dataset that can give both house seekers and house sellers more insights into the housing market in the Netherlands. Mainly, the aim of creating this dataset is to make a houseâ€™s selling duration more predictable. For both parties this can lead to a more efficient housing market: house sellers can better predict for what period their house will be on sale, whilst house seekers get insights into the selling rate in a particular city.\n","permalink":"https://example.com/projects/creations/fundascraper-kopie/","tags":null,"title":"Investigating Funda"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
